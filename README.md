## Projects
This project includes the development of two major projects: an online shop (including checkout and payments functionality) and a blog. These projects serve as practical demonstrations of the concepts learned throughout the course, providing a realistic environment for learning and experimentation.

## Requirements
To run the project locally, follow the below steps:<br>
-> clone the project repository from GitHub <br>
-> you will need to put your own api keys, for email and payment service <br>
-> also change the mongoDB uri to your database's uri<br>
-> then run the command "npm install" in your terminal<br>
