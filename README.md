# E-commerce
A project made with the help of Node.js and Express.js.

At first, i started with basic HTML, CSS and Node & Express. Then went on to add Pug as as templating engine then finnaly switched EJS.

Then i learnt handling the routes and implementing MVC architecture. 

Started with JSON files to save User-Data, and implemented functions to add product, delete product, add to cart, admin page and some other functionality. And as of now, im, learning SQL DB and transitioning into that and modifying the functions.

stay tuned for further updates ;)
